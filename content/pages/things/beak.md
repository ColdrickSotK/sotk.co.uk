Summary: Beak is a web application for editing and publishing blogs and sites generated with Pelican.

Beak is a tool to provide an easy web interface for managing a
[Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) blog.

Beak is currently intermittently in development and some way off
complete. When finished, it will come with a post editor to allow
easy previewing of rendered markdown, and the ability to prepare
posts in advance and schedule publishing them to the blog at a
given time.

It doesn't have any kind of authentication, and currenlty there is
no plan for it ever to have any kind of authentication. It shouldn't
be exposed to the outside world without some extra care.
