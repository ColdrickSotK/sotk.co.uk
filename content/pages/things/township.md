Summary: Township is currently a map generator, and will one day be a town-building game.

Township is an ongoing project that has seen many different
incarnations. It began life as a first year university project,
which ended up as a buggy but somewhat functional game of
gathering resources, building a town, and surviving against
endless waves of enemies.

Later it became an experiment in generation of larger maps,
which was never satisfactorily finished. Even later, it became
an experiment in using OpenGL for 3D rendering.

Now, it is back to its roots as a 2D game written in Python.
Currently it is capable of generating an "infinite" map, and
allows you to assign Stockpiles, which will be how gathered
resources are stored.

Eventually there will be villagers and buildings, with the game
focussing more on building a town which survives well in
the world than surviving endless waves of monsters.
