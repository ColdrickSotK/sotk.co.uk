  I'm a software developer working for Codethink on a variety of projects
  in Manchester, UK.

  I'm an OpenStacker,
  involved with the Infrastructure team as a core reviewer on the
  StoryBoard project,
  a task tracker originally developed under the OpenStack Infra umbrella.

  I like writing Python and Javascript.
  I like writing C++ too.
  I like writing PHP and Java somewhat less.

  I enjoy building worlds to play games in,
  or just for fun.
  Sometimes I hope to write posts here talking about these worlds.

  I sometimes mod old games like Rome: Total War.
  My best mods can be found on the [things](/things) page.

  On some occasions I have been known to draw.
  Normally in an attempt to become happy enough with my drawings
  to feel like I'm doing justice to the world I'm imagining.
